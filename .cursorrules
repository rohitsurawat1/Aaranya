Homepage Improvements:

- The hero section looks good, but consider adding a clear call-to-action (CTA) button, such as "Shop Now" or "Explore Collections".
- Add more content below the hero section, such as featured products, categories, or a brief "About Us" section.



Navigation:

- Implement a proper navigation menu. Currently, there's no way to navigate between different pages or sections of the site.
- Include links to important pages like "Shop", "About", "Contact", and "Cart".



Product Catalog:

- Create a product listing page where customers can browse all available jewelry items.
- Implement product filtering and sorting options.



Product Details:

- Develop individual product pages with detailed information, multiple images, pricing, and an "Add to Cart" button.



Shopping Cart:

- Implement a shopping cart functionality where users can add, remove, and update quantities of items.
- Add a cart summary page and a checkout process.



User Authentication:

- Add user registration and login functionality.
- Create a user profile page where customers can manage their information and view order history.



Search Functionality:

- Implement a search feature to allow users to find specific products easily.



Footer:

- Add a footer with links to important pages, social media icons, and possibly a newsletter signup form.



About Page:

- Create an "About Us" page that tells the story of your brand and highlights the craftsmanship of your jewelry.



Contact Page:

- Add a contact page with a form or contact information for customer inquiries.



Responsive Design:

- Ensure the website is fully responsive across all device sizes. Currently, it looks good on desktop but might need adjustments for mobile devices.



Performance Optimization:

- Optimize image sizes and implement lazy loading for better performance.
- Consider using Next.js Image component for automatic image optimization.



SEO Improvements:

- Add proper meta tags, including title and description, for better search engine visibility.
- Implement structured data for products using JSON-LD.



Integrate with Shopify:

- If you haven't already, integrate your Next.js frontend with Shopify's backend for inventory management and order processing.



Payment Integration:

- Implement secure payment gateways to allow customers to complete purchases.



Customer Reviews:

- Add a review system for products to build trust and provide social proof.



Wishlist Feature:

- Implement a wishlist feature where logged-in users can save items for later.



Related Products:

- On product pages, show related or complementary items to encourage additional purchases.



Blog or Jewelry Care Guide:

- Consider adding a blog section with jewelry care tips, styling advice, or behind-the-scenes content about your crafting process.



SSL Certificate:

- Ensure your site is served over HTTPS for security. (This appears to be in place already with Vercel's deployment.)
